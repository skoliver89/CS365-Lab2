# CS365-Lab2
system calls and Sockets

Part I (15 points) <br />
Create a C program on Ubuntu/Cygwin which demonstrates these system calls <br />

•	fork() <br />
•	wait() <br />
•	exit() <br />
•	exec() <br />
•	system(“date”) <br />

Also, declare an integer, assign it with 88, then print out the content of the variable as an int, a floating point number, and a character and explain the printing result. <br />

Please add comments to your code. As at the top of the program place your name, the date the code is written, and a simple description of your program. <br />

Part II (25 points) <br />
Read section 3.6.1 Sockets, try to understand the Java code about client and server socket. <br />
1.	Type in and test run the code for the DateServer, Figure 3.21 on age 138 <br />
2.	Type in and test run the DateClient code, Figure 3.22 on page 139 <br />
3.	Try your code in our lab. Run the server code on one machine, use ipconfig to figure out its IP address, then run your client code to connect to your “server”, and have your server also (in additional to the date) send over its IP address (hard code this is OK). <br />
